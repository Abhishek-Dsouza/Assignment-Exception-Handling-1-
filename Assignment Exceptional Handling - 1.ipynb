    "### In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, Python stops the normal execution of the program and jumps to a special block of code called an exception handler, which handles the exception.\n",

    "### ZeroDivisionError: Raised when attempting to divide by zero\n",
    "### TypeError: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type\n",
    "### ValueError: Raised when an operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value\n",
    "### On the other hand, syntax errors occur when the Python interpreter detects a syntax error in the code. These errors are caused by mistakes such as missing parentheses, incorrect indentation, or invalid syntax. Syntax errors are detected before the program is executed, and they prevent the program from running.\n",
